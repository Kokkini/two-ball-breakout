# Feature Specification: Two-Ball Breakout (Static Web Game)

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a modern browser game. The game is similar to the classic breakout game but there are 2 balls. A black ball and a white ball bouncing in a 2D box. When the game start, half of the box will be filled with black squares and half with white squares. The black ball starts on a white square, can move freely through white squares, bounces off walls and black squares. When the  black ball bounces off a black square, the square turns white. The white ball starts on a black square, can move freely through black squares, bounces off walls and white squares. When the white ball bounces off a white square, the square turns black. The game continues like that forever. Before the game starts, the user can choose the color themes, the width and height of the box (in terms of squares), the angle that each ball starts with, the number of balls for each color, the speed of the balls."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: How should the grid initialize when W√óH is odd and how to split colors?
  ‚Üí A: Off-by-one allowed; use random seeded distribution.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player, I want to configure the grid size, ball counts, ball starting
angles, ball speed, and color theme, start the simulation, and watch black and
white balls bounce within a grid while flipping square colors according to the
rules so that the motion and visual transformation continue indefinitely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a configured grid of W√óH squares with exactly half black and half
   white squares, and at least one black ball and one white ball, **When** the
   simulation starts, **Then** each black ball is placed on a white square and
   each white ball on a black square, and balls begin moving at the configured
   speed and starting angles.
2. **Given** a black ball moving through the grid, **When** it crosses a white
   square interior, **Then** it moves freely without bouncing and the square's
   color remains unchanged.
3. **Given** a black ball moving toward a black square boundary, **When** the
   ball's boundary (considering its radius) collides with the black square
   boundary, **Then** it bounces (angle of reflection equals angle of incidence
   per elastic collision with axis-aligned edges) and the impacted black square
   turns white.
4. **Given** a white ball moving toward a white square boundary, **When** the
   ball's boundary (considering its radius) collides, **Then** it bounces and
   the impacted white square turns black.
5. **Given** a ball moving toward a wall (outer boundary), **When** the ball's
   boundary (considering its radius) collides, **Then** it bounces with no
   color change.
6. **Given** pre-game configuration is shown, **When** the player edits theme
   (selecting from multiple complementary color palettes), grid size, angles,
   counts, and speed, **Then** the preview updates values and the Start button
   initializes a new simulation with those settings.

### Edge Cases
- Grid initialization with odd W√óH: Off-by-one allowed; use random seeded
  distribution.
- Partition rule for half-black/half-white: Use random seeded distribution.
- Multiple balls simultaneous collision with the same square: Apply toggles per collision order within a tick
- Ball-ball collisions: No collisions between balls, they just pass through
- Corner collisions (wall + square corner): Resolve as double bounce
- Starting positions: Randomly place black balls in white squares and white balls in black squares. The ball radius is 0.3 grid squares (60% of square diameter), ensuring balls are smaller than squares.
- Speed/angle units: Use degrees and squares-per-sec
- Large grids and high ball counts: Ensure performance remains smooth within
  target devices.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a pre-game configuration UI to select
  color theme (from at least 7 options including Classic, Ocean, Sunset, Forest,
  Candy, Holiday, and Luxury), grid width (squares), grid height (squares),
  starting angle for each ball color, number of balls per color, and ball speed.
- **FR-002**: On Start, the system MUST initialize a W√óH grid targeting a 50/50
  split of black and white squares; when W√óH is odd, allow off-by-one using a
  random seeded distribution to assign the extra square.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST place each black ball initially on a white square
  and each white ball on a black square. Placement MUST avoid overlaps. If the number of balls is greater than the number of starting squares, remove the excess balls.
- **FR-004**: Black ball motion: moves freely through white squares; bounces
  when the ball's boundary (radius 0.3 grid squares) contacts walls and black
  square boundaries; upon bouncing off a black square, that square MUST flip to
  white.
- **FR-005**: White ball motion: moves freely through black squares; bounces
  when the ball's boundary (radius 0.3 grid squares) contacts walls and white
  square boundaries; upon bouncing off a white square, that square MUST flip to
  black.
- **FR-006**: The simulation MUST run continuously until paused or reset by the
  user; there is no win/lose state.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow pause/resume and reset to reconfigure
  settings.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST render the grid and balls using the selected
  theme, ensuring sufficient contrast between squares and balls. All themes MUST
  use complementary colors that are visually appealing and not harsh on the eyes.
  The Classic theme MUST use softened black/white (#2C2C2C/#E8E8E8) rather than
  pure black/white for reduced eye strain. Grid squares MUST be rendered without
  border lines, and balls MUST be rendered without strokes for a clean, seamless
  appearance.
- **FR-009**: Wall collisions MUST preserve speed and reflect angle according
  to axis-aligned elastic reflection.
- **FR-010**: Behavior for ball-ball collisions MUST be defined. [NEEDS
  CLARIFICATION: collide/elastically reflect vs pass-through]
- **FR-011**: If two or more balls attempt to flip the same square within the
  same tick, the final color resolution should be a random coin flip.
- **FR-012**: Starting positions MUST be reproducible for a given seed if randomness is used.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GameSettings**: gridWidth, gridHeight, theme (classic|ocean|sunset|forest|
  candy|holiday|luxury), blackBallCount, whiteBallCount, blackStartAngle,
  whiteStartAngle, ballSpeed, seed? (optional)
- **Grid**: width, height, cells (color: black|white)
- **Cell**: x, y, color
- **Ball**: color (black|white), position (x,y), velocity (angle, speed), radius (0.3 grid squares)
