# Research: Two-Ball Breakout

## Decisions
- Rendering library: p5.js (user provided)
- Hosting: Static (no backend)
- Responsiveness: Mobile + desktop

## Open Items
- Testing tools: unit (Jest?) and E2E (Playwright?)
- Performance budgets enforcement in CI
- Accessibility checks (keyboard navigation, contrast)

## Alternatives Considered
- Canvas without framework: rejected (p5.js acceptable and simple)
